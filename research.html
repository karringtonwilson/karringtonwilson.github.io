                <p>HCI RESEARCH - AI FIGHT HUB</p>
                <p>
                    What the project is: <br /><br />
                    AI Fight Hub is a digestible hub for understanding AI Usage cases at Wellesley, and especially to
                    empower students with tools for if they are falsely accused of AI Usage. This project was created in
                    Fall 2024 for CS299 - Research Ethic of Technology.

                <p>
                    How I came up with the idea: <br /><br />

                    One of my partners for the project, Gloria Manhey, was inspired to do a project like this after some
                    friends and colleagues were allegedly falsely accused of using AI in coursework. Along with our
                    group mates, we wanted to create a hub where students and professors can learn more about resources
                    available surrounding AI in academia.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Who I worked with: <br /><br />I worked in a group with Gloria Manhey, Zinuo Shi, and Belle See in
                    our joint computer science class.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What was my role: <br /><br />

                    Aside from helping with the final paper and pubbing out study, I was responsible for the front end
                    development for our website, specifically the user interface and experience, ensuring the platform
                    was intuitive and visually engaging.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What I learned: <br /><br />
                    How AI impacts academia and works behind the scenes. In terms of my responsibilities for the
                    project, I had to balance technical complexity with user-friendly design and ensuring the
                    information we provide was accurate and protecting the safety of students and faculty.

                <p>
                    What challenged me: <br /><br />Simplifying AI mechanics for users unfamiliar with the technology
                    while still making it engaging and useful for those with technical backgrounds.

                    How it relates to my major: <br /><br />
                    It combines my interest in HCI with AI, emphasizing how ethical research can make complex systems
                    more accessible.

                    What the project is: <br /><br />
                    A research study comparing the effectiveness of VR and 2D applications in reducing anxiety and
                    improving interpersonal skills for job interviews. Participants engaged with Bodyswaps: Interview
                    Simulator, in both a VR and a 2D platform, and their stress levels are analyzed.

                <p>
                    How I came up with the idea: <br /><br />
                    From my interest in educational technology and how immersive systems affect learning and emotional
                    response. I wanted to see if VRâ€™s immersive nature made it a better tool for interview prep and
                    stress reduction than traditional 2D training.
                </p>

                    Who I worked with: <br /><br />
                    I worked with Naomi Wang where we conducted our study as part of an advanced HCI research course,
                    collaborating with faculty and fellow researchers while interviewing students and alumni.

                <p>
                    What was my role: <br /><br />Along with Naomi Wang, I designed the study, selected platforms,
                    facilitated user testing, and analyzed participant feedback and stress data for our final
                    presentation. I also wrote the final report for our project.
