Comment: I love this video and I agree with everything but the first one. Entrapta was never a POW. She could have left anytime b4 and after joining.

Date: 2020-10-08 16:48:48
Comment: When I did I say they weren’t? And is it also not valid that black ppl just want to have fun and draw fanfiction?

Date: 2020-10-08 16:38:20
Comment: All I’m saying is its fanfiction about a character whose race isnt directly relevant to their struggle. Azula is “evil” regardless of her Asian race

Date: 2020-10-08 16:36:58
Comment: I’m not looking for an argument. It’s not racism but it’s hurtful about their race?? Is that what ur saying? That makes no sense

Date: 2020-10-08 16:30:26
Comment: The funniest thing is: the people most offended by this are non Asian people. Huh

Date: 2020-10-08 16:29:55
Comment: If you said it’s not racist then why say something in the first place?

Comment: how am I fake woke if I’m directly affected by white washing on a daily basis. I mentioned whitewashing bc THATS actually racist, not this video FOH

Date: 2020-10-08 16:21:01
Comment: -which they already are. Nobody is hurt by a FANFICTION DRAWING. They’re hurt by canon. Point blank period

Date: 2020-10-08 16:20:17
Comment: -and character arcs are not directly based on that or is a consequence of it. Thirdly Tiana should be black and Azula should be Asian CANONICALLY

Date: 2020-10-08 16:19:01
Comment: First of all it’s not canon. It’s a damn fanfiction drawing. Nobody is hurt by that. Secondly it’s based off Asian cultures but their struggles-

Date: 2020-10-08 16:17:55
Comment: Do you... not know what white washing is? Do you not know the historical context behind that? Clearly u don’t do pls google it

Date: 2020-10-08 16:08:20
Comment: It’s FANFICTION ffs not canon.

Date: 2020-10-08 16:07:53
Comment: Its not. The artist didn’t make them white and her asianess isn’t key to her character. Not saying representation isn’t important but this is harmless

Date: 2020-10-05 23:34:51
Comment: He already severely injures people. I mean, irl the henchmen he hurts would be paralyzed, poorer and littered w medical bills. Isn’t that a worse fate

Date: 2020-10-05 23:33:34
Comment: Again: if he feels like killing one person as justice would lead to him killing others unjustly, then why be a hero and not someone in therapy? Lol

Comment: That’s ridiculous and u know it. Athiests aren’t a group of anything. How can they be? The only thing they have in common is not following a religion?

Comment: Black ppl just want to gain knowledge of a place/culture that was taken from them for centuries. There are so many ethnicities in Africa that u can’t-

Date: 2020-09-01 19:12:32
Comment: Nah. It’s appropriation when they wear it just for the hell of it or reclaim it as their own.

Date: 2020-09-01 19:11:11

Comment: Also who tf cares if the universe was created or not created. It bears no weight on our lives so leave it alone.

Date: 2020-08-29 18:03:49
Comment: Just bc nothing is nothing doesn’t mean that there’s a god. The two don’t correlate with each other.

Date: 2020-08-29 18:02:48

Date: 2020-08-29 16:23:40

Date: 2020-08-27 11:51:21
Comment: Yeah... bc he already shot and killed somebody prior to that unprovoked. So ofc ppl are gonna chase him to stop from killing other people. Think a bit

Date: 2020-08-27 11:44:16
Comment: HOW tf can y’all justify a kid with an illegal killing people for no reason? HOW tf are y’all not upset that the cops did nothing about it?

Date: 2020-08-27 11:43:23
Comment: Also in this video you see clearly that he shots clearly unarmed people and then casually walked away knowing that he would get away w it.

Date: 2020-08-27 11:42:27
Comment: It’s not self defense. He killed someone and was stopped by a guy who had a LEGAL pistol. Or did y’all forget that kids can’t have guns legally?

Date: 2020-08-24 20:47:51
Comment: It’s not like it was a season finale. And even so, asami and Korra acknowledges they have feelings. They weren’t declaring love or anything.

Date: 2020-08-24 20:47:12
Comment: The creators have said that it was planned a whole year before the finale. And how can it get ratings when the show ENDED?

Comment: To put is simply: it’s internalized self hatred that she projects on other people around her. She’s a byproduct of racism, not racist

Date: 2020-08-24 19:58:34
Comment: Also peer pressure and white girls being the standard o beauty plays more of a role than racism

Date: 2020-08-24 19:55:41
Comment: I love that it’s both yes and no. However, I would more so say no bc it’s internalized hatred/colorism, not necessarily racism

Date: 2020-08-24 18:17:35
Comment: I haf ya disagree wit ya Massa, but my statement was not racist. White ppl do not experience racism Massa

Date: 2020-08-24 18:11:37

Comment: -about Mako and Korra or Asami and Mako. They came out of the blue too using your logic. Stop being so heteronormative 🥰

Date: 2020-08-24 17:47:41
Comment: It was hinted as early as season three and intended for longer. Nick censored the hell out of LGBT ppl but not straight ppl. Also u can say the same-

Comment: I’m sorry you have no taste. I hope you get help soon🥰

Comment: Then you must hate Toph, Azula, and Zuko as well then

Date: 2020-08-24 16:22:32
Comment: I think it’s the fact that Toph is bound (so it’s misguided empathy for some ppl ig) but mainly internalized colorism.

Date: 2020-08-24 14:05:49

Date: 2020-08-23 22:53:52
Comment: He wasn’t a bad dad like abuse or hating his kids. He was just neglectful. He still loved his kids and would do anything for them so that’s why I said

Date: 2020-08-23 20:41:43
Comment: are you surprised that Toph was an absent mom? Based on her personality and her growing up it makes sense. Doesn’t mean they didn’t love their kids

Date: 2020-08-23 20:40:58
Comment: Didn’t ruin his character. It was realistic. If you think about it, are you surprised that Aang was kinda neglectful/had favoritism? No it makes sense

Comment: She didn’t destroy them. It got ripped from her and the cycle restarted. From the STRONGEST villain in the universe. It was unavoidable.

Comment: It doesn’t. But it’s realistic. Aang was a neglectful father but it doesn’t mean it was out of character nor does it make him a bad person

Comment: There’s no right way to protest bc they shouldn’t have to. Who tf cares about looting when those businesses are protected and have insurance?

Date: 2020-08-22 21:36:01
Comment: The world either straight up wanted her dead (RL), disliked her bc of previous avatars, were indifferent, or wanted to take advantage of her. Sooo

Date: 2020-08-22 21:34:25
Comment: It also would’ve been less realistic because-let’s be honest here- the og Team Avatar kinda fucked shit up in the world (w/o meaning to ofc but still)

Date: 2020-08-22 21:32:21
Comment: Honestly those reasons r kind of ridiculous to cut yourself off from a whole new experience. Just say you like lightskinned Aang better and move on🥴

Date: 2020-08-22 21:30:40
Comment: In fact Aang himself would have “lost” the past lives if it wasn’t for Kataras magic juice lol. Harmonic Convergence hinted it was gonna happen anyway

Comment: Sokka has nothin good to do with LOK and even so, how did they even ruin him. Korra just restarted the cycle. It was gonna happen eventually. 2/

Comment: The characters from LOK are perfectly fine, lovable and realistic. They didn’t ruin the OG characters, it’s just realistic (many don’t like that). 1/

Date: 2020-08-22 20:48:04
Comment: Absolutely. It’s one of the various reasons I relate to her. Gifted kid, dark skinned woman, bisexual, trauma, social awkwardness etc. etc.

Comment: And Hermione lowkey

Date: 2020-08-22 20:30:35
Comment: Its not a coincidence that ppl want a female Aang or a lighter skinned Korra or a male Korra... bc they don’t like dark skinned women

Date: 2020-08-22 20:29:21
Comment: Yea, def not a coincidence. Look at how Korra is treated v. Aang. Or Katara is treated v. Zuko. Even Korra v Kuvira or Katara v Azula.

Comment: She doesn’t even have a pfp of herself or anything that legitimizes this. Most importantly, she’s unqualified and we don’t need another one of those-

Date: 2020-08-14 04:12:58
Comment: Also she’s depending on broke teenagers and college kids to provide her w the ability to get on the ballot. Her page is an unprofessional spam page.

Date: 2020-08-14 04:11:45
Comment: We don’t know her nor do we know any of her policies (at least from this video). She’s asking for signatures but we don’t know what she stands for??

Date: 2020-08-14 04:03:15
Comment: EVERYBODY PLEASE DONT VOTE FOR HER. She didn’t state any policies so we don’t even know if she’s legit. Also voting for her will split the votes so

Date: 2020-08-14 03:45:29
Comment: You do realize that those same parties will split the vote meaning that here is less ppl for the blue. Also it’s rare a 3rd party candidate would win

Date: 2020-08-14 03:36:09
Comment: If we want to stop trump we’re gonna have to vote for Biden. Reps stick together no matter how racist the candidate. We can’t split the blue vote

Date: 2020-08-14 03:34:25
Comment: Good in theory but we CANNOT do that. If we want to truly get rid of Trump we can’t split the democratic vote. That’s how we got here in the 1st place

Comment: If it was rare then people wouldn’t feel the need to com out the closet. Or feel pressured to not wear their hijabs. Bigotry is real in Christianity

Date: 2020-08-11 07:09:09
Comment: No not all Christians push their beliefs. But an alarming amount of them do to the point where transphobia is an epidemic in this country, for example

Date: 2020-08-11 07:04:03
Comment: The Bible and it’s believers are quite hypocritical/oxymoronic. In reality a good chunk of believers are bigoted in some way. The religion enables it

Date: 2020-08-11 07:03:00
Comment: And bc there’s no right way to worship there’s no right way to preach. Meaning that you can do complete asinine shit and still be a Christian

Date: 2020-08-11 07:02:25
Comment: They actually are called to presch their beliefs in the Bible. It’s like the main thing God/Jesus tells them to do in the book.

Comment: You can say MLK was a fake Christian and Hitler was a true one bc of your specific morals for example. Extreme but true

Date: 2020-08-11 07:00:12
Comment: It’s like morality. There’s no right or wrong way. A Christian can’t tell another christian they’re fake bc they worship differently

Date: 2020-08-11 06:59:25
Comment: The thing is - if you read the Bible clearly - there are multiple ways to praise god. So there’s no right or wrong way to worship god

Date: 2020-08-11 06:57:51
Comment: It’s also undeniable that OMG wasn’t a phrase back in biblical times so “taking gods name in vain” wasn’t meant that way

Date: 2020-08-11 06:57:17
Comment: Other Christians agree with me. It’s an undeniable fact that many Christians push the Bible to fit their agenda

Date: 2020-08-11 06:54:26

Comment: It’s not coincidence that Jesus is human and god just like Greek Roman and some East Asian religions had. Therefore, Jesus seems pretty pagan to me

Date: 2020-08-08 01:47:28
Comment: Yeah. And in pagan religions polytheism exists. And in those religions there are beings who are human and god. Jesus is human and god

Date: 2020-08-08 01:26:59
Comment: Still a god and a human. Still died as a human and was susceptible to all human things (except sin). Seems pretty pagan to me

Date: 2020-08-08 01:24:31
Comment: And both are supernatural. No human alone can spit in dirt and cure blindness without some sort of intervention. That’s shit seems magical to me

Comment: He is part god and part human. He’s a god in a human body. Not literally a demigod but very close to one, no?

Date: 2020-08-08 01:22:26

Comment: You don’t need a training montage for something to be developed. I, and many other ppl, were just waiting for the moment he’d succeed. And he did

Date: 2020-08-08 01:03:29
Comment: Did you watch the video? It wasn’t about training alone, it was about him letting go of his expectations.

Date: 2020-08-08 00:58:46

Comment: That’s great for her. But one person doesnt represent the whole. Addiction isn’t a simple issue that can fix itself.-

Date: 2020-08-07 01:07:26
Comment: The WHOLE point of decriminalizing isn’t to promote drug use (even tho it will go up). It’s to make sure people don’t DIE and can get help. That’s it

Date: 2020-08-07 01:06:48
Comment: EXACTLY. You cant get rid of drugs therefore you cant get rid of addiction permanently. The best u can do is manage it so less ppl die & can get help.

Date: 2020-08-07 01:04:45
Comment: And before u say “to scare them off” it DOESNT. And u only need to take drugs once to get addicted. That’s where decriminalizing it comes into play

Date: 2020-08-07 01:03:51
Comment: And making the drug illegal doesn’t stop its production or ppl using it. So it’s not actually helping shit. Why put it there in the first place?

Date: 2020-08-07 01:02:28
Comment: Ur cousin is a victim to addiction. That’s the point. The victim shouldn’t be punished they should be helped. When did I say addiction is illegal?

Date: 2020-08-07 01:00:53
Comment: That’s the whole point of addiction. You don’t “get rid” of anxiety after one therapy session. Addiction is the same

Date: 2020-08-07 01:00:11
Comment: It may work the first time. It may not. It’s not that simple because addictions not that simple. Addiction doesn’t go away after one time

Date: 2020-08-07 00:59:30
Comment: Ppl are going to do it even if you r told not to. That’s why monitoring is the best we can do. U can’t get rid of drugs so u can’t get rid of users

Date: 2020-08-07 00:57:00
Comment: Yeah? Look where that got us. Doesn’t stop the fact that ppl will use REGARDLESS of its legality/criminalization. HELLO! That’s the whole point!

Date: 2020-08-07 00:55:16
Comment: Punishment won’t fix shit. The only time it should be punished is if being under the influence leads u to commit crimes (like DUIs which already exist

Date: 2020-08-07 00:54:13
Comment: So you get punished for having an addiction? My guy, you dont CHOOSE to get addicted. Even if you did help should always be available, not jail.

Comment: That’s why I specifically mention overdoses and death. More ppl will use but less ppl will die. It’s better than its opposite.

Date: 2020-08-07 00:50:40
Comment: Yeah drug usage will for sure go up. But ppl will be more likely to get the help they need bc many don’t get it due to fear of jail time.

Date: 2020-08-07 00:47:11
Comment: So a person with a mental health issue deserves to die from the problems they have? That’s kinda immoral don’t ya think

Date: 2020-08-07 00:45:35
Comment: if we decriminalize drugs (not the same as legalize) the same positive result may come about. Considering how unjust our Justice syst. is, it’s better

Date: 2020-08-07 00:40:36
Comment: So clearly criminalizing doesn’t work. Other countries legalized and overdoses dropped. Here it just gets worse. Which one seems better?

Date: 2020-08-07 00:39:26
Comment: I mean, drug users eventually get out of jail and their addiction definitely doesn’t go away leading to overdoses. They damn sure don’t get NA in jail

Date: 2020-08-07 00:32:15

Comment: Yknow you don’t have to use all caps right? Nat was not his rebels and vice versa. each person is accountable for their own actions. 🤷🏾‍♀️

Date: 2020-07-08 17:45:55
Comment: With that being said, he did immoral shit but it’s understandable why he did so. yt ppl did it just to be murderous and feel superior,

Date: 2020-07-08 17:45:01
Comment: That’s funny cuz white people said the same thing for 400 years prior in support of slavery, killing/raping black women and babies 🧐

Date: 2020-07-08 17:39:59
Comment: Again what he did may have been immoral but it’s nothing compared to what white ppl have done to all black ppl no matter their age or gender

Date: 2020-07-08 17:39:12
Comment: Again, Nat Turner himself did not kill children. It was some of his rebels who went out of their way to do so. And when did he promote slavery????

Date: 2020-07-08 17:32:48
Comment: He was fighting against a system that was wrong and immoral so his “evil actions” can’t be looked down upon bc he should have had to do it

Date: 2020-07-08 17:31:55
Comment: Most people didn’t own slaves but that didn’t mean they weren’t racist. His actions pale in comparison to what racists at the time did

Date: 2020-07-08 17:31:22
Comment: Firstly, He never physically killed a child or babies. Secondly it was not a massacre he was fighting against white supremacy.

Date: 2020-06-26 23:36:00
Comment: I’ve come to one conclusion/assumption: you don’t read fully, you assume things about ppl, and you don’t care about the Bible enough to support it

Date: 2020-06-26 23:33:52
Comment: That’s the problem isn’t it? A believer can’t even back up their own beliefs with a simple scripture verse. Damn shame 😔✊🏾

Date: 2020-06-26 23:32:51
Comment: It’s a Christians job to convert ppl to Jesus Christ so if I was a nonbeliever you singlehandedly would ruin my desire to be a Christian

Date: 2020-06-26 23:31:10
Comment: How are they different? Please I just want to know.

Date: 2020-06-26 23:29:30
Comment: See? This is the exact reason why people don’t like Christians. You can’t answer one question and you jump to conclusions. You make all of us look bad

Date: 2020-06-26 23:28:24
Comment: I’m not a witch stop assuming I am . And two I never called God a witch. Simply said that his miracles are scarily similar to the practices of witches

Date: 2020-06-26 23:27:32
Comment: I’m not trying to argue with you. Just answer the question. You can’t just say oh bc the Bible says so and think that’s good enough

Date: 2020-06-26 23:26:55
Comment: Honey it’s a simple question. My statements are perfectly valid you are just find long them offensive for some reason

Date: 2020-06-26 23:25:47
Comment: TLDR: Saying “oh bc the Bible and her assumed belif says so” doesn’t answer my questions. Why does it say so and where so I can study it

Date: 2020-06-26 23:24:37
Comment: You said you answered my question but you really didn’t. That’s why I’m “taking up our time.” I genuinely want to know the reason behind what you said

Date: 2020-06-26 23:23:52
Comment: I’m speaking a lot I’m not mad. I’m annoyed bc you won’t answer the question: why does the biblle claim witchcraft or paganism as disrespectful.

Date: 2020-06-26 23:21:10
Comment: No it doesn’t. There are witches who are Christian bc paganism and witchcraft are two different things. Ones a belief ones a practice

Date: 2020-06-26 23:19:40
Comment: All you told me was that paganism is disrespectful to your religion. You never told me why it is. Why does the Bible and your belief claim it so?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:17:40
Comment: Again how is simply asking if he was a prophet or a witch disrespectful? She has valid reasons to think that so Just answer her question.

Date: 2020-06-26 23:16:45
Comment: Again, you’re assuming. Again if she wasn’t actually curious and was Islamic she wouldn’t comment this bc it’s disrespectful, would she?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:15:43
Comment: Again my religion has nothing to do with my statements. Like at all. Can’t you understand it w/o taking my beliefs into account?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:14:48
Comment: It was a comparison. We are talking about Christianity AND witches. Never said Christians were witches, just said that He and witches did same stuff

Date: 2020-06-26 23:11:19
Comment: PLEASE tell me - I’m deadass curious - as to why you feel it’s disrespectful when all she said was “Prophet” and “witch” in the same sentence

Date: 2020-06-26 23:09:23
Comment: answer simple questions with something that actually makes sense. Don’t try to undermine my comments w/ this. They’re simple questions. Answer them

Date: 2020-06-26 23:08:37
Comment: My religión has nothing to do with the conversation but no I’m not a witch. I’m also not taking this personal. It’s just irritating that you can’t

Date: 2020-06-26 23:07:30
Comment: would have the same reaction as you?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:07:19
Comment: Are you sure? Or are you assuming you know her. Also if the two religions are mostly similar, why are you assuming she’s being disrespectful if she

Date: 2020-06-26 23:05:52
Comment: Please answer and properly read through all my questions and statements before making an asinine comment like this one. Thanks 😘

Date: 2020-06-26 23:05:09

Comment: *jump for

Date: 2020-06-26 23:02:58
Comment: Why would you be so offended if I did? Seriously. Answer that too. Why are you so quick to jump to a non physical being you’ve never met?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:02:01
Comment: How? It’s in the BIBLE. Read it. I’m not making this stuff up. Please tell me where and how I’m calling God a wit?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:01:00
Comment: How in earth was she being disrespectful? Can you honest to God answer a straightforward question?

Date: 2020-06-26 23:00:33
Comment: But you don’t seem to understand the key point: it’s not disrespectful to ask a question nor to put Christian and witch in the same sentence.

Date: 2020-06-26 22:58:04
Comment: You can disagree/dislike witches bc a book and your mind told you so, but just keep in mind that the mere presence of other beliefs don’t attack yours

Date: 2020-06-26 22:56:47
Comment: If you didn’t know that name may appear in Muslim culture but a person with that name doesn’t mean their Islamic. So stop jumping to conclusions

Date: 2020-06-26 22:55:56
Comment: after your belief system? Are you that insecure about your beliefs that a simple question like this is taken to heart? Also do you know Khadijah?

Date: 2020-06-26 22:53:05
Comment: Secondly you can be a witch and Christian at the same time. Thirdly Proohets and God himself LITERALLY cast curses on bloodlines, turn water into wine

Date: 2020-06-26 22:52:12
Comment: Do you even read the comments thoroughly? bc I don’t think you are. First off I never said anything about Christians being witches or vice versa.

Date: 2020-06-26 22:44:48
Comment: Disrespectful. So don’t say I’m cherry picking anything because you failed to realize the point of this sound

Date: 2020-06-26 22:43:55
Comment: Nobody is cherry picking anything. Yt ppl can use the sound but should be towards Black empowerment. Dancing & taking over smth not meant for them is

Date: 2020-06-26 22:42:38
Comment: White creators do on TikTok? Also white ppl have never been oppressed like POC always have been, so they will never experience “segregation”

Date: 2020-06-26 22:41:45
Comment: Oh? I didn’t know you knew MLK so well. Because last time I checked wasn’t he the same one who spoke out against white ppl who did what

Date: 2020-06-26 20:52:43
Comment: I know. That’s the upsetting part. I wish it simply wasn’t a thing

Date: 2020-06-26 20:51:00
Comment: You believe what you want to but witches/paganism isn’t a bad thing like I think other Christians/Muslims do. It’s simply another belief system

Date: 2020-06-26 20:49:45
Comment: But still that wasn’t disrespectful though. I mean curses are a thing that witches do so it’s weird that’s in ur religion in the first place.

Date: 2020-06-26 00:39:13
Comment: There’s TOO many details for that to 1) not be a subliminal image and 2) not be drawn by a racist then mass produced

Date: 2020-06-26 00:38:02
Comment: not be hand drawn. Meaning somebody clearly drew that, purposely drew that subliminal image and mass printed it

Date: 2020-06-26 00:37:16
Comment: Also printers back then aren’t like modern day ones which I think is your first mistake. As you can see the designs on the bill are too detailed to...

Comment: Forgot to add: Poverty in the black community isn’t caused by laziness or whatever. It’s bc of systemic racism and the cops that uphold racist laws

Date: 2020-06-25 16:24:10
Comment: That means that there must be something wrong systemically to the point where black ppl are DISPROPORTIONATELY poor. Think about it

Date: 2020-06-25 16:22:41
Comment: Oh YEAH. You can’t compare the number of poor white to poor black ppl. Why? Bc White people make up 70% of the pop. And black ppl make up 13%

Date: 2020-06-25 16:21:06
Comment: So therefore Poverty AND Racist laws/government entities lead to a higher crime CONVICTION rate. Not bc of any other reason (“culture”or skin color)

Date: 2020-06-25 16:19:11
Comment: “higher crime rates” White people are less likely to get pulled over and searched even though, statistically, they are in higher possession of drugs

Date: 2020-06-25 16:17:57
Comment: Poverty - from lack of government support- leads to more crimes. Also there is a higher CONVICTION rate & black ppl are unfairly targeted, leading to

Date: 2020-06-25 16:16:05

Comment: It’s not that hard to comprehend. A sound used to uplift black people being taken over yet again by yt ppl shouldn’t be overlooked. Just one thing

Date: 2020-06-23 02:03:59
Comment: Nobody is saying white people cant use the sound. But you don’t need to. Why not let black ppl use it when there are dozens of others y’all can use?

Date: 2020-06-23 02:02:46

Date: 2020-06-23 02:01:05

Date: 2020-06-23 00:32:46
Comment: It’s one audio. Why can’t yt ppl leave it alone?🤨 Y’all touch & takeover everything & THEN get mad when we say it’s not for you. History proves it

Comment: You still don’t get it, do you? What are you even saying? Like what the fuck is your argument because you obviously are confused. Please read a book

Date: 2020-06-15 20:45:47
Comment: What kind of argument is that? You’re proving my point further.Since men have such a problem w supporting living kids you don’t have a say in abortion

Date: 2020-06-15 20:43:58
Comment: Thats completely different. you should want to support your child. If you have such a problem w CHILD SUPPORT, you shouldn’t say shit about abortion

Date: 2020-06-15 20:31:26
Comment: You are wrong AND you’re ignorant. And I’m a woman so I can make that claim. You, however, can’t because you aren’t a woman. What don’t you get?

Date: 2020-06-15 18:35:45
Comment: No I’m not (read: irrelevant to the conversation). Abortion happens to clumps of cells you (a male) aren’t capable of producing, not babies 🙂 ✨

Date: 2020-06-15 18:33:17
