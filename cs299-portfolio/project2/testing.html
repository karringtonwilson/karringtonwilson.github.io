                    Well, for starters this webpage is for the CS299 class of course. But in general, this project
                    highlights my tech usage over a certain time period. The last week of September, to be specific.
                    Over the course of the week, I tracked various things: the devices I used the most, the apps or
                    websites I frequented, and my feelings regarding my tech usage. I think this project is something
                    that anybody can and should do (if possible of course). During my class so far, we have learned
                    about technomoral virtues and data feminism. If you want to learn more about technomoral virtues,
                    you should check out Shannon Vallor’s book titled the same as well as my first project from this
                    semester. <br />
                    <br />
                    However, this project is inspired by Catherine D'Ignazio’s and Lauren Klein’s book “*Data
                    Feminism.*” If you couldn’t tell by the title, this book talks about how data has been collected in
                    the past and present and how it is absolutely necessary to contextualize data from an intersectional
                    feminist standpoint. The authors considered there to be 7 core principles of Data Feminism:
                    <br /><br />
                    1. **Examine power** 2. **Challenge power** 3. **Elevate emotion and embodiment** 4. **Rethink
                    binaries and hierarchies** 5. **Embrace pluralism** 6. **Consider context** 7. **Make labor
                    visible**
                    <br /><br />
                    These core principles inform the path I took in regards to collecting and contextualizing my own
                    data. My personal motivations for the project were informed by the themes in the Watch Dogs 2 (WD2)
                    video game. “What were the themes in the game,” you may ask. Well, it is important to note that in
                    our technology filled world, our personal data is everywhere all at once (peep the movie reference).
                    Nowadays everyone who has even a slight online presence is tracked through our cookies and search
                    history. <br /><br />Have you ever received an advertisement for a new DSLR camera after google
                    searching for one just a few hours before. Yup! That’s corporations selling your data to advertisers
                    so you can buy more and more and more. In a way, this process I took over a week was a way to take
                    control of the narrative over my own personal data, similar to how Marcus and Dedsec from WD2 used
                    his knowledge to inform others around them about how their data was being used. I knew going into
                    this that I wouldn’t stop my personal data from being sold, but I can contextualize my usage and
                    habits to better understand myself, my wants, my needs, and daily routine. <br />
                    <br />
                    Here’s the fun part: I’m going to take you through a journey of my tech usage from my week of
                    exploration. Below, you have the option to choose a device and a part of the week to see how my data
                    was being used. You get to see my journal entries (ooooooooo scary inner thoughts time! Kidding…
                    it’s not thatttt scary lol) as well as my manual data collection. Then you will see my data usage
                    from Spotify and TikTok from this week. Why these two specifically? Well, they are my most used
                    apps! At least, according to my browser history and screentime on my phone. ANYWAY, I’ll stop
                    yapping and start letting you explore <em>MY TECH USAGE.</em> <br /><br />Have Fun!! <br /><br />

                <p>
                    - Thanks for taking this journey with me! There are a few things I learned about myself (hint: what
                    I list below can be seen briefly in my journal entries). <br />
                    <br />
                    - I am bored… A LOT. And that boredom leads to: Scrolling TikTok - I use Notion A LOT. More than
                    Google Docs and Microsoft Word - I open productivity apps more often but I spend the longest
                    cumulative on my more fun apps like TikTok and AO3 in one stretch. - I use Spotify so much that the
                    only accurate to track my usage is downloading my data - I often feel two emotions at once: neutral
                    and bored, negative and stressed or bored, positive and productive or amused simultaneously <br />
                    <br />
                    - As for the Data Collection and Research Process I’ve learned: <br />
                    <br />
                    - there are many ways to visualize data outside of charts and bar graphs. I mean.. obviously - A
                    scary amount of my data is just… there. In the cloud servers of the technology I use. Kinda weird… -
                    Code really really helps make the large amounts of data be condensed and visualized easily - Working
                    with JSONs are a bit easier than you think. Especially once you recognize its similarities to CSV
                    files (aka the things used in spreadsheets) - Speaking of, I learned that you can convert said JSON
                    files to CSV to import into excel. I will definitely use this in the future - Its better to track
                    yourself periodically than all the time every time. I learned this about half way through my
                    research process and wish I applied it sooner. - I did a LOT of research into the coding behind the
                    files I worked with and how it is visualized. It is easier to use python but you can use your pdfs
                    and excel files to create a markdown for your HTML page. I will most definitely use this when I work
                    with data again. <br />
                    <br />
                    - Overall, this was a very intensive process but I learned a lot about how data is stored and then
                    visualized. Thanks again for taking this journey! Feel free to mess around the webpage (PS I might
                    continue updating this page often just to see how my data has changed or remained the same)

                <br /><br />
                <p>
                    So, just to clarify, as part of my evaluation for my manual data, I tracked to the best of my
                    ability my usage of my phone. I asked myself the following questions: <br />
                    1. When did I open my phone? 2. How long did I use an app for? 3. What were my feelings during this?
                    and 4. Was I bored?<br />
                    I asked myself these questions because before I started this project, I knew that I often used my
                    devices pretty absentmindedly.<br />
                    I exported a portion of my journal to an excel sheet then produced charts from the data. I have
                    attached the images of my manual data below! My journal entries and digital traces will come after
                    you see my questionnaire first, as expected of course!

                    I’m just going to give a heads up now: I SUCK at journaling. I mean, if you couldn’t tell already, I
                    am a YAPPER. I looooove to talk. And I am blessed enough to have a great support system so I usually
                    just vent to them instead of writing down my feelings. But I tried my best for this project! For my
                    journal, I just checked in with myself about three times a day: Morning, Mid-Day and Evening. I
                    summarized my feelings for that time and how it informed my tech usage at the time. At the end, I
                    gave myself a cute little emoji which summarized my feelings for the day overall. Check below to see
                    my inner thoughts and reflections :) (oooo scary!! again… not really. I’m just a theater kid y’all!)

                    hindsight, I also grossly underestimated how much I used TikTok and Spotify. Once I received my
                    data, I decided to track how much I used these apps by visualizing how many videos I liked per hour
                    during my TikTok sessions and the amount of songs I listened to per hour while using Spotify.
                    (Spoiler alert: I listened to an almost worrisome amount of music on Spotify) <br />

                    So, just to clarify, as part of my evaluation for my manual data, I tracked to the best of my
                    ability my usage of my phone. I asked myself the following questions: <br />
                    1. When did I open my phone? 2. How long did I use an app for? 3. What were my feelings during this?
                    and 4. Was I bored?<br />
                    I asked myself these questions because before I started this project, I knew that I often used my
                    devices pretty absentmindedly.<br />
                    I exported a portion of my journal to an excel sheet then produced charts from the data. I have
                    attached the images of my manual data below! My journal entries and digital traces will come after
                    you see my questionnaire first, as expected of course!

                    I’m just going to give a heads up now: I SUCK at journaling. I mean, if you couldn’t tell already, I
                    am a YAPPER. I looooove to talk. And I am blessed enough to have a great support system so I usually
                    just vent to them instead of writing down my feelings. But I tried my best for this project! For my
                    journal, I just checked in with myself about three times a day: Morning, Mid-Day and Evening. I
                    summarized my feelings for that time and how it informed my tech usage at the time. At the end, I
                    gave myself a cute little emoji which summarized my feelings for the day overall. Check below to see
                    my inner thoughts and reflections :) (oooo scary!! again… not really. I’m just a theater kid y’all!)

                    am a YAPPER. I looooove to talk. And I am blessed enough to have a great support system so I usually
                    just vent to them instead of writing down my feelings. But I tried my best for this project! For my
                    journal, I just checked in with myself about three times a day: Morning, Mid-Day and Evening. I
                    summarized my feelings for that time and how it informed my tech usage at the time. At the end, I
                    gave myself a cute little emoji which summarized my feelings for the day overall. Check below to see
                    my inner thoughts and reflections :) (oooo scary!! again… not really. I’m just a theater kid y’all!)

                    Okay… so remember how I said corporations stay tracking our data. Well, yeah. They definitely
                    tracked mine. And let me just tell you know: I did not know that so much of my data was tracked. In
                    hindsight, I also grossly underestimated how much I used TikTok and Spotify. Once I received my
                    data, I decided to track how much I used these apps by visualizing how many videos I liked per hour
                    during my TikTok sessions and the amount of songs I listened to per hour while using Spotify.
                    (Spoiler alert: I listened to an almost worrisome amount of music on Spotify) <br />
                    By the way, if you want to see what I learnt about myself and my tech use, go to the Weekend link

                    So, just to clarify, as part of my evaluation for my manual data, I tracked to the best of my
                    ability my usage of my phone. I asked myself the following questions: <br />
                    1. When did I open my phone? 2. How long did I use an app for? 3. What were my feelings during this?
                    and 4. Was I bored?<br />
                    I asked myself these questions because before I started this project, I knew that I often used my
                    devices pretty absentmindedly.<br />
                    I exported a portion of my journal to an excel sheet then produced charts from the data. I have
                    attached the images of my manual data below! My journal entries and digital traces will come after
                    you see my questionnaire first, as expected of course!
