                        <p>
                            Lacie Pound (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a character in the Netflix series Black Mirror. In the
                            episode Nosedive, Lacie is in a world where your social status means everything... yet
                            nothing, really, at the same time. Throughout majority of the episode, Lacie utilizes the
                            virtue of self-control in her attempts to reach and maintain a high rating of 5 stars in her
                            social-media infested world. Her rigid self-discipline is admittedly for the "wrong" reasons
                            as her self-control is for the purpose of gaining social capital. This example of
                            self-control may differ from what Vallor had in mind in her book "Technology and the
                            Virtues" but is still a good example of what self-control can look like both in a positive
                            and negative light.

                            Lucy Miller (Scarlett Johansson) is the protagonist for the movie Lucy. At the beginnning of
                            the movie Lucy gains superhuman powers such as telekenesis, telepathy, and others. Lucy,
                            despite her killing many people over the course of the film, actualizes the virtue of
                            humility by using her superhuman abilities to further progress science and technology. Her
                            humility is the reason humanity is able to acheive greater feats in spite of the moral
                            dillemas and the literal ability to transcend time and space.

                            introverted-leaning demeanor is contrasted with his sensitivity towards other people's

                            In the film “Oppenheimer”, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is in the midst of another
                            world war and has the knowledge and tools to create one of the deadliest weapons created by
                            mankind: the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy was nominated and won several awards for his
                            portrayal of the real-life Oppenheimer. His portrayal of the infamous physicist was wrought
                            with questions of the ethical and moral dilemmas and responsibilities scientists interact
                            with on a daily basis… just in a larger, paramount way. Murphy’s Oppenheimer showcased
                            technomoral wisdom as he was aware of the danger creating and releasing an atomic bomb can
                            do for everyone worldwide. By being aware of the ethics of such a dangerous task,
                            Oppenheimer showed prominent features of being a technomorally wise person.

                            Legends universe and one of the protagonists for the Netflix show “Arcane”. The show centers
                            around the relationship between herself and her younger sister Powder, now known as Jinx. Vi
                            grew up in the poor, crime ridden below ground region of Piltover where, after the death of
                            her parents by Piltover enforcers, she becomes the primary caregiver for her younger sister.
                            Throughout the course of the show, we see Vi grapple with the realities of her world and the
                            corruption and oppression that sets the fabric of her society. From a young age, Vi became
                            relentless in her pursuit of justice as she develops and, later, uses her skills to fight
                            against the oppressive systems of her city. Her self sacrifices and pursuit for equal rights
                            clearly embodies the virtue of justice.

                            android companion, Markus, to help with his everyday tasks. In a world where humans often

                            son. In the short time we know Carl, we see him as a mentor to Markus who encourages the
                            android to think for himself and have self-respect. He interacts with Markus who, like many
                            androids, is gaining sentience because of his artificial intelligence. Manfred does not look

                            and technological skills to take down large corrupt tech corporations (Blume). Throughout

                            B2S is a uniwue concept as the game does not follow a liner timeline, instead jumping back
                            and forth between different timelines and points of view. Perspective as a virtue is
                            implemented quite literally in the game as Jodie can physically see and interact with
                            objects and people in any environment she can access through Aiden. Jodie changes various
                            times throughout the game as her actions are influenced by her psychic connection and the
                            scientists who hold control over her life. Jodie has perspective in both the literal and
                            metaphorical sense because of her powers and experiences in life, influencing the technology
                            that surrounds her waking moments.

                            Markus (Jesse Williams) is one of the three playable characters in the 2015 game “Detroit:
                            Become Human” (DBH), which explores themes of android and human relationships and the
                            ethical dillemmas associated with technological advancement. Williams, most known for his
                            work in “Grey’s Anatomy” portrays Markus, an RK200 android created by the fictious tech
                            company Cyberlife. In DBH, androids are treated as second class citizens, hammered in by
                            imagery similar to that of the real life Civil Rights Movement in the United States. With
                            the help of his owner/mentor Carl Manfred, Markus is able to gain sentience and free himself
                            from technological servitude. In his journey, he leads Jericho, a revolutionary group
                            created by other free androids who dedicate their lives for android equal rights. Players of
                            the game can choose to be pacifist or anarchist while controlling Markus. Regardless of
                            player choice, the character of Markus exemplifies the virtue of magnanimity as his
                            leadership and selflessness toward android liberation emphasize the moral goodness regarding
                            technology.
