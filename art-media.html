                    created in Intermediate Video Production, a Cinema and Media Studies (CAMS) course. These projects

                    <b>How I came up with the idea: </b> <br /><br />This horror short was inspired by structuralist
                    film, which is a film/video in which the presence of the camera and the making of the film become a
                    major character in its narrative. I shot this short video using my dorm environment and
                    neighborhood, as well as editing in sounds to give the film a creepy feeling while remaining
                    structuralist at its core.

                    peers.

                    Balancing conceptual depth with accessibility for viewers. Some ideas felt too abstract, so I worked
                    on making them more engaging without losing artistic intent. I also want to edit these further in
                    the future to make the narrative tighter and possibly expand on them further.

                    <b>How I came up with the idea: </b> <br /><br />
                    This short video was inspired by appropriated films, which is a collage film consisting of images
                    appropriated from film/television/internet. My short film explored my history in the Christian
                    church as a black, queer child and teenager. It included videos of homophobic pastors, parishioners,
                    and Kanye West speaking on homophobia in the black community and the hip hop sphere.

                    (Work in Progress) A rhythm game, made for ARTS 255, that celebrates Black film history. This is
                    based on the <a href="blackfilmarchive.com">Black Film Archive</a>

                    What the project is: <br /><br />
                    A rhythm-based game that celebrates Black cinema and music, incorporating visuals and audio from
                    iconic Black films found in the Black Film Archive. Players match beats while the related music
                    video plays in the background. After some gameplay, players have to correctly answer which black
                    film or show the song featured in, is referenced to, or is connected to.

                    How I came up with the idea: <br /><br />
                    I wanted to merge my love for film, music, and interactive design into a game that both entertains
                    and educates about Black cinematic history. I wanted to emphasize the connection between music and
                    storytelling. This was inspired by games like Dance Dance Revolution, Friday Night Funkin, and Beat
                    Saber but with a black, cultural focus.

                <p>
                    Who I worked with: <br /><br />
                    I developed this game by myself with some help from reddit forums on proper BPM implementation. As
                    this is an HTML5 game, I focused on UI/UX design and gameplay mechanics.
                </p>

                <p>--------------------</p>

                <p>
                    What was my role: <br /><br />I created the design, the idea, and chose what movies, shows, and
                    songs to include. Currently, I am debugging rhythm mapping to align visuals and music better.

                <p>
                    What I learned: <br /><br />
                    How to design an interactive rhythm game, the importance of rhythm mapping in beat game mechanics,
                    and what songs have been featured in some of the media I found.
                </p>

                <p>--------------------</p>
                <p>
                    What challenged me: <br /><br />Fair use considerations when incorporating film and music clips,
                    ease of play, and timing with BPM. Also, enhancing interest through further game mechanics (adding
                    lives, adding quizzes, etc.).

                    interactive storytelling.
